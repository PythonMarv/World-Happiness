# World-Happiness

## Data Consistency and Wrangling
Python was used for data consistency and wrangling steps. Columns were derived as necessary to support analysis.

## Analysis
Exploratory analysis was performed to answer key questions. Insights were derived from the data.

## Visualizations
Various visualizations were generated using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate patterns and trends in the data.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, recommendations were formulated and sent to the client. These recommendations include strategies for raising ones happiness derived from this data and additional data driven research.

## Objective
To  offer a thorough and precise conclusion of the Happiness Score and correlating factors, I integrated pivotable variables including Economy(GDP per Capita), Health(Life Expectancy), Trust(Government Corruption), Family, Generosity, and Freedom.

### Key Questions
1. What is the distribution of happiness scores across different regions?

2. How does the GDP correlate with happiness score?

3. What countries are the happiest and unhappiest?

4. Is there a correlation between family support and happiness score?

5. Is there a correlation between trust in government and happiness score?

6. Is there a correlation between health and happiness score?

7. Are people more generous in happier countries?

8. Is there a correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy?

9. Are there any significant differences in happiness score between developed and developing countries?

10. How has the happiness score changed over the years?
